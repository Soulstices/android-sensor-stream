ðŸ“¡ Android Sensor Stream â€” A lightweight Android service that collects accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data and streams it over UDP in real-time.

This app runs as a foreground service on Android, continuously capturing motion and orientation data from device sensors and broadcasting it via UDP for real-time use in robotics, simulation, motion tracking, or remote sensing applications.
